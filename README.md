This repository hosts the NOAA-NWFSC D-loop database for members of the Sebastidae and select Scombridae.

The primers were developed to identify northeast Pacific rockfish species, and _in silico_ amplify almost all members of the scorpion fish family as well as most of the scombridae. Details of primer development and intitial application to environmental DNA detection of rockfishs can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0337724).

Details including primer sequence, code supporting database development and update as well as the most current version of the database can be found in the [Metabarcoding](https://github.com/MVEverett-NOAA/RockfishMetabarcoding/tree/Metabarcoding) section.

Details on the genome skimming efforts carried out to fill in species gaps and look for additional species haplotypes can be found in the Genome Skimming section.
